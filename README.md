As it is the first week of COMP30950 Multi-paradigm programming. I want to get used to te Scala programming language.
This is a project that is supposed to mimic a traffic light intersection simulation.
Currently it is a predictable traffic pattern with every signal having a certain amount of time to display its lights.
Later on I will need to implement of form of motion detection, this will ensure a more realistic approach to a traffic intersection.
Anybody viewing this repository feel free to mention any ideas to me to improve this program.

Current ideas
- motion deecting to skip empty roads
- pedestrian button to stimulate realistic scenario
- time change during peak hours of the day
- multithreading for multiple intersections
